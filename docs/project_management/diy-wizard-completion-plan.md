## 📋 **Phase 3: System Integration**

### **Task 3.1: Cost Analytics Integration**
**Estimate**: 1 development session  
**Priority**: Medium

**Requirements:**
- Connect parts/fluids cost data to Vehicle Details analytics
- Display parts vs fluids cost breakdown
- Show cost per service insights
- Maintain existing analytics functionality

**Technical Changes:**
- Update Vehicle Details cost analytics to include parts/fluids data
- Enhance cost calculation logic to separate parts and fluids
- Update analytics display components
- Test analytics with new maintenance logs

### **Task 3.2: End-to-End Testing & Polish**
**Estimate**: 1-2 development sessions  
**Priority**: High

**Requirements:**
- Complete DIY wizard flow testing
- Complete Shop Service wizard flow testing
- Error handling and edge case testing
- Performance testing with large datasets
- UX polish based on testing feedback

**Testing Scenarios:**
- New user complete DIY service logging flow
