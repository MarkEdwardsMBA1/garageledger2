**üéâ PHASE 1 COMPLETE**: Navigation restructure successfully implemented!
**Next**: Programs feature moved to separate Phase 2 project with atomic increment breakdown

## Phase 1: Navigation Restructure
**Goal**: Remove Dashboard, make Vehicles the home screen, rename Maintenance to Insights
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks  
**Risk Level**: Medium (navigation changes affect core user flows)
**Current Status**: Phase 1 foundation complete - ready for content migration phase

---

## Increment 1: Remove Dashboard from Navigation ‚è±Ô∏è 2-3 hours ‚úÖ COMPLETED

## Increment 3: Content Migration Analysis ‚è±Ô∏è 1 hour ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Objective**: Audit what Dashboard content should migrate vs delete
**Risk**: Very Low (analysis only, no code changes)
**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed - Comprehensive migration plan created

### Tasks:
- [x] Document Dashboard sections:
  - [x] Welcome section (DELETE - move to onboarding)
  - [x] Maintenance Insights (DELETE - redundant with superior Insights version)
  - [x] Quick Stats (MIGRATE - vehicle count, upcoming maintenance)
  - [x] Quick Actions (DELETE - redundant with improved Vehicles screen)  
  - [x] Recent Activity (MIGRATE - recent maintenance logs)
- [x] Identify Insights screen gaps
- [x] Plan content integration approach

### Deliverable:
- [x] Migration plan document with detailed content mapping

### Analysis Results:
- **To Migrate**: Quick Stats cards (high value) + Recent Activity section (medium value)
- **To Delete**: Welcome section, redundant Maintenance Insights, redundant Quick Actions
- **Recommendation**: Proceed with Increment 4 (Quick Stats migration)

## Testing Strategy

### After Each Increment:
1. **Functional Testing**: Core navigation and features work
2. **Regression Testing**: Existing features unaffected  
3. **Performance Testing**: No significant performance degradation
4. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Works on iOS and Android

### Final Phase 1 Testing:
1. **Full User Flow Testing**: Complete user journeys work end-to-end
2. **Edge Case Testing**: Error states, empty data, poor connectivity
3. **Accessibility Testing**: Screen readers, navigation work correctly
4. **User Acceptance Testing**: Navigation feels intuitive
