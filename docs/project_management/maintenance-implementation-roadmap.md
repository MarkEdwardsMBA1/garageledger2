## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Evolution
```
Phase 1: Basic MaintenanceLog collection
Phase 2: + MaintenancePrograms, MaintenanceTemplates  
Phase 3: + MaintenanceParts, MaintenanceFluids (as subcollections)
```

### Security Rules Progression
```javascript
// Phase 1: Basic log protection
match /maintenanceLogs/{logId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
}

// Phase 2: Add program and template rules  
match /maintenancePrograms/{programId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
}

match /maintenanceTemplates/{templateId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
}
```

### Performance Considerations
