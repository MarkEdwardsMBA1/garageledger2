## 🏗️ **Phase 2: Vehicle Home Page (Major Feature)**

### ✅ **Complete Vehicle-Centric Experience**
**New Screen**: `VehicleHomeScreen.tsx` - Individual vehicle deep-dive

**Features Implemented:**
- **Vehicle Header**: Year/Make/Model, current mileage, notes
- **Quick Actions**: Log Maintenance (pre-filled), Add Reminder (placeholder)
- **Status Summary**: Vehicle-specific maintenance status
- **Maintenance Timeline**: Recent 5 logs with "View All" link  
- **Cost Insights**: Total spending for this specific vehicle
- **Smart Navigation**: Back to Vehicles, Edit vehicle access

**Navigation Integration:**
- **Vehicles Screen**: Tap vehicle card → Vehicle Home Page
- **Dashboard**: Recent activity → Vehicle Home Page  
- **Seamless editing**: Header "EDIT" button → Edit Vehicle screen

## 🎯 **Phase 3: Fleet Command Center (Transformation)**

### ✅ **Maintenance Screen Redesign**
**From**: Simple history + add button  
**To**: Professional fleet management command center

**New "Fleet Status" Tab:**

### ✅ **Removed Global Maintenance Logging**
