  tasks: ProgramTask[];
  assignedVehicleIds: string[];
  isActive: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface ProgramTask {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  category: string;
  intervalType: 'mileage' | 'time';
  intervalValue: number;
  estimatedCost?: number;
  reminderOffset?: number;
}
```

- [ ] Implement task creation/editing within program
- [ ] Add task interval configuration (mileage/time)
- [ ] Include category selection for tasks
- [ ] Add form validation and error handling

### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Program creation flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Tasks can be added/removed/edited
- [ ] Form validation prevents invalid data
- [ ] Created programs appear in list
- [ ] Data persists correctly to Firebase

---

## Increment 5: Vehicle Assignment ‚è±Ô∏è 2-3 hours
**Objective**: Allow assigning programs to vehicles
**Risk**: Medium (relationship management)

### Tasks:

- [ ] Show assigned programs in vehicle detail pages
- [ ] Handle program assignment/unassignment
- [ ] Update vehicle screens to show active programs

### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Programs can be assigned to multiple vehicles

- [ ] UI clearly shows assignment status
- [ ] No data consistency issues

---

## Increment 6: Program Management ‚è±Ô∏è 2-3 hours

## Testing Strategy

### After Each Increment:
1. **Functional Testing**: Programs functionality works as expected
2. **Integration Testing**: Programs integrate with existing features (vehicles, maintenance logs, reminders)
3. **Performance Testing**: No degradation with multiple programs/vehicles
4. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Works on iOS and Android
5. **Localization Testing**: All text properly translated

### Final Phase 2 Testing:
1. **End-to-End Programs Flow**: Create program ‚Üí assign to vehicle ‚Üí track status ‚Üí complete tasks
2. **Business Logic Testing**: Complex scenarios with multiple programs and vehicles
3. **Data Integrity Testing**: Program assignments and completions persist correctly
4. **User Acceptance Testing**: Programs feature feels intuitive and valuable

---

## Rollback Strategy

### If Issues Arise:
1. **Increments 1-2**: Remove Programs navigation tab, revert to 3-tab structure
2. **Increments 3-6**: Hide Programs screens, functionality remains in database
3. **Increments 7-8**: Disable program status/reminder generation, manual reminders continue working

---

## Future Phase 3: Advanced Programs (6-8 weeks)
- Multi-vehicle program templates
- Cost forecasting based on program schedules
- Program sharing between users
- Integration with service provider APIs
- Advanced compliance reporting
