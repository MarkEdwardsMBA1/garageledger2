### Repository Pattern Evolution

#### MVP Foundation (Phase 1)
```typescript
// Simple MVP interfaces - fast to implement, proven patterns
interface IBaseRepository<T> {
  create(data: Omit<T, 'id'>): Promise<T>;
  getById(id: string): Promise<T | null>;
  getAll(filters?: any): Promise<T[]>;
  update(id: string, data: Partial<T>): Promise<T>;
  delete(id: string): Promise<void>;
}

// MVP implementation - gets us to market quickly
class MaintenanceLogRepository implements IBaseRepository<MaintenanceLog> {
  private collection = firestore().collection('maintenanceLogs');
  
  async create(data: Omit<MaintenanceLog, 'id'>): Promise<MaintenanceLog> {
    const docRef = await this.collection.add({
      ...data,
      createdAt: FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
    });
    return this.getById(docRef.id);
  }
  
  // Category localization at service layer
  async getLocalizedLogs(vehicleId: string, language: string): Promise<MaintenanceLog[]> {
    const logs = await this.getByVehicleId(vehicleId);
    return logs.map(log => ({
      ...log,
      localizedCategory: i18n.t(`categories.${log.category}`, { lng: language })
    }));
  }
}
```

#### Advanced Features (Phase 2-3)
```typescript
// Extended interfaces - added progressively without breaking MVP
interface IAdvancedRepository<T> extends IBaseRepository<T> {
  // Phase 2 enhancements
  search(query: string): Promise<T[]>;
  getByCategory(category: string): Promise<T[]>;
  getCostAnalysis(filters?: any): Promise<CostAnalysis>;
  
  // Phase 3 advanced features
  getAnalytics(params: AnalyticsParams): Promise<AnalyticsData>;
  getSuggestions(vehicleId: string): Promise<Suggestion[]>;
  generateReport(params: ReportParams): Promise<Report>;
}

// Same implementation class - methods added over time
class MaintenanceLogRepository implements IAdvancedRepository<MaintenanceLog> {
  // All MVP methods continue working unchanged
  
  // Phase 2-3 methods added as features are developed
  async getCostAnalysis(filters?: any): Promise<CostAnalysis> {
    const logs = await this.getAll(filters);
    return this.computeCostAnalysis(logs);
  }
  
  async getSuggestions(vehicleId: string): Promise<MaintenanceSuggestion[]> {
    // Phase 3 ML-powered suggestions
    return this.mlService.generateSuggestions(vehicleId);
  }
}
```

### Phased Data Model Evolution

#### Phase 1: MVP Models (Simple & Fast)
```typescript
// Core models - minimal viable data structures
interface Vehicle {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  make: string;
  model: string;
  year: number;
  vin?: string;
  mileage: number;
  notes?: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface MaintenanceLog {
  id: string;
  vehicleId: string;
  date: Date;
  mileage: number;
  title: string;
  category: string; // Stored as key, translated at presentation
  cost?: number;
  notes?: string;
  tags: string[];
  photos: string[];
  createdAt: Date;
}

interface UserPreferences {
  userId: string;
  language: 'en' | 'es';
  currency: 'USD' | 'MXN' | 'COP' | 'ARS';
  measurements: 'imperial' | 'metric';
  notifications: { 
    language: 'en' | 'es';
    enabled: boolean;
  };
}
```

#### Phase 2-3: Enhanced Models (Backward Compatible Extensions)
```typescript
// Models extend with optional fields - existing code unaffected
interface Vehicle {
  // MVP fields remain required and unchanged
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  make: string;
  model: string;
  year: number;
  vin?: string;
  mileage: number;
  notes?: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  
  // Phase 2+ enhancements (all optional)
  name?: string; // "The Red Wagon"
  photo?: string;
  group?: VehicleGroup;
  tags?: string[];
  isActive?: boolean;
}

interface MaintenanceLog {
  // MVP core unchanged
  id: string;
  vehicleId: string;
  date: Date;
  mileage: number;
  title: string;
  category: string;
  cost?: number;
  notes?: string;
  tags: string[];
  photos: string[];
  createdAt: Date;
  
  // Phase 3 advanced features (optional)
  type?: MaintenanceType;
  performedBy?: ServiceProvider;
  breakdown?: {
    parts: MaintenancePart[];
    fluids: MaintenanceFluid[];
    labor: LaborDetail[];
  };
  receipts?: string[];
  language?: 'en' | 'es';
}

// Phase 3: New advanced models (don't affect MVP)
interface VehicleAnalytics {
  vehicleId: string;
  period: 'month' | 'quarter' | 'year';
  totalSpent: number;
  costByCategory: Record<string, number>;
  maintenanceFrequency: Record<string, number>;
  predictiveInsights: MaintenanceSuggestion[];
}

interface MaintenanceProgram {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  scheduleItems: MaintenanceScheduleItem[];
  vehicleIds: string[];
  isActive: boolean;
}
```

### i18n Technical Implementation

#### Localization Architecture
```typescript
// Language detection and persistence
const getDeviceLanguage = () => {
  const locales = getLocales();
  return locales[0]?.languageCode === 'es' ? 'es' : 'en';
};

// Maintenance categories with regional variations
const MAINTENANCE_CATEGORIES = {
  en: {
    'oil-change': 'Oil Change',
    'brake-service': 'Brake Service',
    'tire-rotation': 'Tire Rotation'
  },
  es: {
    'oil-change': 'Cambio de Aceite',
    'brake-service': 'Servicio de Frenos', 
    'tire-rotation': 'Rotaci√≥n de Llantas' // Mexico/Colombia
  }
};

// Regional customization
interface LocalizationConfig {
  currency: 'USD' | 'MXN' | 'COP' | 'ARS';
  measurements: 'imperial' | 'metric';
  dateFormat: string;
  language: 'en' | 'es';
  region: 'US' | 'MX' | 'CO' | 'AR';
