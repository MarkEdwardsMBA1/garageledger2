#✅ Essential Legal Documents & User Agreements

## 1. Terms of Service (ToS)

What it is:
Your legal contract with users describing what your app does, the limits of your liability, acceptable use, IP rights, and so on.

Must include:

-	That GarageLedger does not provide professional advice (mechanical, legal, safety, etc.)
-	That users are responsible for the accuracy and appropriateness of the data they enter and any decisions they make based on it
-	A disclaimer of liability (especially for missed maintenance, car damage, etc.)
-	Acceptable use policy (e.g., no illegal content)
-	Termination clause
-	Governing law (typically your home jurisdiction)

User acknowledgment needed? ✅ Yes — require acceptance during signup (checkbox: “I agree to the Terms of Service” with a link)
 
## 2. Privacy Policy

What it is:

A legally required explanation of what user data you collect, how you use it, how it’s stored, and how users can manage/delete it.

Must include:

-	What personal data is collected (email, name, vehicle info, log entries, usage data)
-	How that data is used (e.g., to populate timeline, enable notifications)
-	Whether any third parties (e.g., analytics providers, hosting services) get access
-	Data retention and deletion policies
-	User rights under laws like GDPR, CCPA (if applicable)

User acknowledgment needed? ✅ Yes — show during signup; often bundled with ToS checkbox.
 
## 3. Disclaimer / No Advice Clause

What it is:

A plain-language section in either your ToS or a separate disclaimer that states GarageLedger does not offer vehicle maintenance advice or recommendations.

Example language:

“GarageLedger is a digital logbook tool. It does not provide professional automotive advice, guidance, or repair instructions. All maintenance and modification decisions are the responsibility of the user.”

User acknowledgment needed?

-	✅ Required inside the Terms of Service (legally binding)
-	❌ Optional to highlight again in-app (but smart to do so on relevant screens, e.g., when users log maintenance)
 
## 4. Cookie/Tracking Consent (if web-based)

If you're using cookies or tracking tools (e.g., Google Analytics) in the web app, and operate in regions like the EU or CA:

User acknowledgment needed? ✅ Yes — use a cookie banner with Accept/Deny option.
 
🧾 Recommended Signup Flow Language

Here’s a simple, clear phrasing you can use at account creation:

✅ I agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
🔒 We value your privacy. Your data stays yours.
🛠️ GarageLedger does not offer automotive advice. You are responsible for all maintenance decisions.
 
## 5. 📋 Smart Additions

-	EULA (End-User License Agreement): If you distribute through app stores, this may be required by Apple/Google — often boilerplate.
-	Data Processing Agreement (DPA): If you're handling data for users in the EU, and especially if you process data through third-party services.
