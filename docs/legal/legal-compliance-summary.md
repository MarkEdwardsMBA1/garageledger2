## üì± User Experience Strategy

### **Legal-Safe UX Principles:**
1. **User Empowerment:** "You create," "Your schedule," "Your choice"

3. **Clear Disclaimers:** Visible on every maintenance screen
4. **Source Transparency:** All data clearly marked as "user-created"
5. **Owner's Manual References:** Consistent guidance to official sources

### **User Journey (Legal-Safe):**
```
[Onboarding] ‚Üí [Legal Agreements] ‚Üí [Account Created]
    ‚Üì
[Create Vehicle] ‚Üí [Create Maintenance Program] 
    ‚Üì
[Enter Your Own Intervals] ‚Üí [Set Your Reminders]
    ‚Üì
[Track Your Maintenance] ‚Üí [Analyze Your Data]
```

**Key:** User drives every decision, app just stores and organizes data.
