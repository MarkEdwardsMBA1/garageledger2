  - **Investigation needed**: Check if MaintenanceScreen.tsx is using proper i18n hooks or has hardcoded English text
  - **Priority**: Medium
  - **Story Points**: 3-5
  - **Status**: üìã Backlog - Localization bug

### Performance Issues  
- **BACKLOG-PERF001**: As a user, I want smooth transitions between splash and sign-in so that the app feels polished and professional
  - **Context**: Recent regression - brief flash of onboarding screen before Sign-in screen appears
  - **Root Cause**: OnboardingStack defaulted to "Welcome" screen first, causing Welcome to flash before navigating to Login
  - **Resolution**: Set `initialRouteName="Login"` in OnboardingStack to skip onboarding flash for returning users
  - **Additional Changes**: Added "New to GarageLedger?" ‚Üí "Learn More" link on Login screen to access Welcome/onboarding flow
  - **Priority**: High (recent regression, affects first impression)
